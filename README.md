# A few Instructions
- First of all, sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com). I hope you now how to do that.
- Then, you may go [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) and navigate using the pane on the left side, and go through everything until you understand. Make sure to visit [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects), as it will be the thing you will be doing the most.
- Some additional resources:
	- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/ (no need to do the `git` part, you can just use the web version of github.)
	- https://medium.com/swlh/a-beginners-guide-to-github-e4747a93765c (this is also a good one, i had used it earlier.)
	- just try and be curious about all the things and you can even ask me, either here, using issues, or personally.
- For the MarkDown (.md file special formatting), you can use [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for help.
